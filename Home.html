    <h1> What is Quality? </h1>
    <p>
        Quality refers to the degree of excellence or superiority of a product, service, or process. It is a multidimensional concept that encompasses various aspects and characteristics, depending on the context in which it is applied. In general, quality can be defined as meeting or exceeding customer expectations and requirements.
        <br>
        The American Society for Quality (ASQ) defines quality as "the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs." This definition emphasizes the importance of meeting customer requirements and expectations in determining the quality of a product or service.
