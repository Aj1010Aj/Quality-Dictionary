    <h1> What is Quality? </h1>
    <p>
        Quality refers to the degree of excellence or superiority of a product, 
        service, or process. It is a multidimensional concept that encompasses various
        aspects and characteristics, depending on the context in which it is applied. 
        In general, quality can be defined as meeting or exceeding customer expectations 
        and requirements.

        <h3> <u>What is ASQ saying about quality</u></h3>
        
        <i>The American Society for Quality (ASQ)</i> defines quality as "the totality of 
        features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability
         to satisfy stated or implied needs." This definition emphasizes the 
         importance of meeting customer requirements and expectations in determining
          the quality of a product or service.
