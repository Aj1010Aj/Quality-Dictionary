         <h3 class="midlevelh3">FMEA</h3>
        Also called: potential failure modes and effects analysis; failure modes, effects and criticality 
        analysis (FMECA)Begun in the 1940s by the U.S. military, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a
         step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly 
         process, or a product or service. It is a common process analysis tool."Failure modes" means the ways, 
         or modes, in which something might fail. Failures are any errors or defects, especially ones that affect
        the customer, and can be potential or actual."Effects analysis" refers to studying the consequences of 
        those failures.Failures are prioritized according to how serious their consequences are, how frequently
        they occur, and how easily they can be detected. The purpose of the FMEA is to take actions to eliminate
        or reduce failures, starting with the highest-priority ones.Failure modes and effects analysis also 
        documents current knowledge and actions about the risks of failures, for use in continuous improvement. 
        FMEA is used during design to prevent failures. Later itâ€™s used for control, before and during ongoing 
        operation of the process. Ideally, FMEA begins during the earliest conceptual stages of design and 
        continues throughout the life of the product or service.

       Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) APQP is a structured approach to product and process design. 
       This framework is a standardized set of quality requirements that enable suppliers to design a product

       <br>Statistical process control (SPC) is defined as the use of statistical techniques to control a process 
       or production method. SPC tools and procedures can help you monitor process behavior, discover issues in

      <br>A sampling plan allows an auditor or a researcher to study a group (e.g. a batch of products, 
       a segment of the population) by observing only a part of that group, and to reach conclusions with a
